predict dementia diagnosis using a Comprehensive health data set The data set includes key health related features such as Diabetic status Heart rate Blood oxygen Levels Body temperature Cognitive test scores And lifestyle Factors We employed milliliter techniques to predict dementia onset Leveraging algorithms such as support vector machines SVM And logistic regression Our findings demonstrate that milliliter Models Particularly SVM and logistic regression Can effectively identify key predictors and achieve Substantial accuracy in Dementia prediction The primary aim of this study is to validate The performance of milliliter models in detecting dementia at an Early stage and to identify the most influential health and Cognitive factors contributing to dementia risk', 'segments':
