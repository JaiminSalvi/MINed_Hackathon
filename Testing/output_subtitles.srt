 ABSTRACT.

7
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,920
 This paper investigates the application of machine.

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,039
 Learning.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,259
 Milliliter.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,259
 Models to predict dementia diagnosis using a Comprehensive Health Data Set.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,740
 The data set includes key health-related features such as diabetic status, heart rate,

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:51,859
 blood oxygen, levels, body temperature, cognitive test scores, and lifestyle.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,399
 Factors.

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,479
 We employed milliliter techniques to predict dementia onset.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,579
 Leveraging algorithms such as support vector machines.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,119
 SVM.

17
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,079
 And Logistic Regression.

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,040
 Our findings demonstrate that milliliter.

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,239
 Models.

20
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,700
 Particularly SVM and Logistic Regression.

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,900
 Can effectively identify key predictors and achieve substantial accuracy in dementia

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,519
 prediction.

23
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,739
 The primary aim of this study is to validate.

24
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:30,780
 The performance of milliliter models in detecting dementia at an early stage and to identify

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,260
 the most influential health and cognitive.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,480
 Factors contributing to dementia risk.
