## Project Overview
Researchers often struggle with summarizing and extracting meaningful content from lengthy academic papers. Our solution addresses this challenge by automating the summarization process and transforming research papers into multiple content formats, such as:

- *Podcasts* (audio format for auditory learners)
- *Videos* (visual representation of the content)
- *Graphical Abstracts* (comics/infographics)
- *PowerPoint Presentations* (formal and casual styles)

This tool reduces the time and effort required for researchers and students to digest large volumes of academic content.

## Problem Statement
To build a tool that can generate new-age, alternative-form content from research papers, helping users comprehend academic material efficiently.

## Features
- ✅ *Text Extraction:* Extracts content from research papers section-wise.
- ✅ *Summarization:* Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate concise summaries.
- ✅ *Content Transformation:* Converts text into various alternative formats (Audio, Video, PPT, and Infographics).
- ✅ *User Customization:* Allows users to adjust language, tone, and duration of content.

## Technical Approach
1. *Extract text* from research papers.
2. *Summarize each section* using LLMs like Llama-3.3-70b-versatile.
3. *Generate visuals* using an open-source AI model.
4. *Transform content* into multiple formats:
   - 🎙 *Podcast* (Text to Speech Conversion)
   - 📽 *Video* (Automated visual creation and narration)
   - 📊 *PowerPoint Presentations* (Bullet points + Image generation)
   - 🎨 *Graphical Abstracts* (Comics/Infographics)
